# UI Fixes for gollama-chat

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Fixed RAG Collection Synchronization
**Problem**: Selected collections in the RAG Collections tab were never communicated to the chat model's RAG service.

**Solution**: 
- Added collection synchronization when switching to the Chat tab
- Added real-time sync when collections are selected/deselected in the RAG tab
- Added `CollectionsUpdatedMsg` message type to communicate changes
- Collections are now properly synchronized between tabs

### 2. Fixed Input Field Loading State
**Problem**: 
- User prompt didn't disappear after pressing enter
- Loading state didn't show "Thinking..." properly
- Input field showed both user text and "[Thinking...]"

**Solution**:
- Modified input field to show "Thinking..." instead of user text during loading
- Added RAG status display in the input field (e.g., "Thinking... (Searching documents...)")
- Input now properly clears when loading starts

### 3. Removed Debug Messages from UI
**Problem**: RAG debug messages like "RAG: No relevant documents found" were appearing in the UI.

**Solution**:
- Removed debug `fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ...)` calls that were cluttering the output
- RAG status is now shown in the input field instead of as error messages

### 4. Enhanced RAG Status Display
**Problem**: Users had no feedback about RAG processing.

**Solution**:
- Added RAG status in the input field during processing
- Shows "Searching documents..." when RAG is active
- Shows "RAG not ready" when RAG is configured but not working
- Clear visual feedback about document retrieval

## Code Changes Made

### 1. `/internal/tui/tui/tui.go`
- Added `syncRAGCollections()` method
- Added collection sync when switching to Chat tab
- Added handling for `CollectionsUpdatedMsg` messages

### 2. `/internal/tui/tabs/rag/rag.go`
- Added `CollectionsUpdatedMsg` message type
- Modified collection toggle actions to send update messages
- Added automatic sync when collections are loaded

### 3. `/internal/tui/tabs/chat/chat.go`
- Added `GetRAGService()` method for external access
- Added `ragStatusMsg` message type
- Enhanced loading state with RAG status display
- Added RAG status initialization when starting message processing

### 4. `/internal/tui/tabs/chat/input/input.go`
- Added `ragStatus` field to Model struct
- Added `SetRAGStatus()` method
- Modified `View()` method to show proper loading state
- Enhanced loading display to show "Thinking..." with RAG status

### 5. `/internal/tui/tabs/chat/messages.go`
- Cleaned up debug output (removed stderr messages)
- Simplified RAG error handling

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Start the application**: `./bin/gollama-chat`
2. **Configure RAG**: Go to Settings → Enable RAG → Set ChromaDB URL
3. **Select Collections**: Go to RAG Collections → Select desired collections (● = selected)
4. **Test Chat**: Go to Chat → Send a message
5. **Observe**:
   - Input field should show "Thinking... (Searching documents...)" during processing
   - No duplicate status bars
   - Proper RAG context integration in responses

## Expected Behavior

### Before Message Send:
- Input shows cursor and user text
- User can type normally

### After Pressing Enter:
- Input immediately shows "Thinking..."
- If RAG is enabled and ready: "Thinking... (Searching documents...)"
- If RAG is not ready: "Thinking... (RAG not ready)"
- No duplicate UI elements

### After Response:
- Input returns to normal state
- Response includes RAG context if documents were found
- Clean, single status bar

## Performance Notes

- Collection synchronization happens only when needed (tab switches, collection changes)
- RAG status updates are lightweight UI operations
- No impact on message processing performance
